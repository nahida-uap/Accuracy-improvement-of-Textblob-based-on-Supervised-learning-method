this app so much. I just want to suggest something. Regarding the stickers, 
I think you should add an interface/mode wherein users can actually create 
their own ""sticker folder"" which can be renamed. For example I want to 
collect and to save stickers that I want to use always or the stickers that 
have the same color. I could create a folder and name it as ""pink stickers"" 
and insider that folder are SPECIFIC stickers that I normally use on a 
daily basis. I hope you could give this a try. I would be glad if this will 
come true. Goodluck! And also fix some common errors hehe.",pos
