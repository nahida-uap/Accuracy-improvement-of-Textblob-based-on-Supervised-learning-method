There are lot features that can be use but still can't satisfy me and I need to use other apps for editing.

Face detection of skin may help. *Makeup - I need to use makeup app in order to beautify your face. Having different hair, eyebrows, eye lens, lips, countour and etc.. *Blending and Layer - must have perspective positioning the image for example I want to replace the image in the billboard. *Different brushes - use to paint and add effects just like in photoshop.

Everything else works on the app as well, just the loading of messages that don't. Currently using an old Samsung phone.  EDIT: If I go to ""Online Friends"", I can click on any of them, and from there I can access and use messages, specifically for that user, still not when clicking the general ""Messages"" however, that hangs as before.",neg

people back from switching wouldn't be such a powerful force. This messages 
app should be able to do everything iMessage can do and more. I know it's 
in the developers to do this, especially with RCS technology getting into

If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer. But you don't have that choice once they delete app. Its strange you want to make your money from add customers and not cuz of a quality product when you indeed have such. That's called greedy and not proud of your product. Don't be greedy and in time Your product will stand on its own with lots of customers and less adds. Number two issue is I have to stop to let the texting catch up. And I'm not even the fastest typer. Its very frustrating. If I'm excited or even angry and therefore passionate about what I'm texting to someone, I don't want to have to stop...wait...for...the...words...I...text...to...catch...up...get it? Number three, when I choose a theme, should it not over ride any background pic I formerly decided to choose? The theme pops up on the keyboard and the boarder of background wallpaper behind the messages but the pic I had chosen as my wallpaper prior to the theme remains. It looks choppy as they are nowhere close to being anything of the same topic. If I can't get this resolved I will not keep app as I'm all about the visuals. Last but not least, when I'm composing a msg, the keyboard stays on top of the msg. I cannot see what I'm typing. Why? I'm a terrible typed and must review what I'm composing. I shouldn't have to minimize the keyboard to do this. I have never had to do so until I added your app.",neg

It even has the best and loudest in-app video player I've seen in these kinds of app. That said, notifications are a bit delayed, which is why I always miss calls. I also still can't share links, photos, or videos from my newsfeed to labeled group chats. I'd have to tag each member one by one and even then, my post would still show up on a duplicate thread with our names as the default label instead of appearing on the already existing thread with the customized group name. Also, I wanna use night mode but it doesn't look too good in my opinion because of the design and colors used. Some stuff aren't even clearly visible. The notification light blinks too fast and too long in its current configuration as well. Lastly, I hope you make it faster and easier to switch accounts from the left side drawer, make it possible to more conveniently download photos in chat just by long-pressing the thumbnails instead of opening them one by one, and make a way for us to be able to download videos, especially from chat threads, not just the newsfeed. UPDATE: Working links/attachments posted by other people on chat threads don't appear anymore. I'm sure it's not because the links are dead or the attachments are unavailable/taken down already as I can see and open them just fine on Messenger Lite. That said, I checked the Facebook desktop site/view on my mobile browser (Chrome app) and I don't see the links/attachments either, while Facebook's mobile view on said browser doesn't let us view messages at all, as usual and forces us to install the app or switch to the desktop site. By the way, sometimes the bottom advertisements block the option/button to see all notifications. Closing them doesn't even work because that just replaces them with other targeted advertising.",pos

actually touching my phone. Not good. At all. Use with caution. Update...it 
actually DOES take pictures of you when you least expect it and usually not 
very nice shots. Was picking up my phone to move it prior to getting into 
the shower and it took my picture while I did not have a hand on anything. 
It was completely embarrassing and should be illegal!",neg
