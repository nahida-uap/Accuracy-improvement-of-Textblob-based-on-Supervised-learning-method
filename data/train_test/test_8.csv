FB, has a HORRIBLE interface, and has ridiculous features (if I haven't 
sent a new friend a message, PLEASE don't create a chat informing me that I 
made a new friend). The only reason I use this terrible messaging app is 
because people that I need to contact use this. Any other messaging app is 
a HUGE improvement over this. LINE, WhatsApp, or even Skype provides a more 
decent messaging experience than this atrocity.",neg
 This app is the exact app that I wanted to.awesome!!!,pos
