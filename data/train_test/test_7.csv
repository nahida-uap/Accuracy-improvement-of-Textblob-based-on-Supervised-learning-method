it will just shut down on me out of nowhere. Mid conversation it shuts

everyday. I looked up how to fix it or why it happens and didn't really get 
that far. Everything tells you yo delete or uninstall the app then 
re-install it and when I tried that it did nothing. If anyone has had this 
issue and was able to fix it please let me know what to do or if anyone has 
advice on other options I would like to know.",neg
