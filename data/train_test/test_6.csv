issue where it will close and reopen, which is quite annoying when you have

it would be perfect. There is no option to create a custom vibration for 
notification which is huge. Also no option for custom emoji or themes. As 
well as no do not disturb option for individual conversations. I hate to 
say it, but iMessage still has you guys beat here with features. If there 
was a way to implement all these similar features, the major app holding 
people back from switching wouldn't be such a powerful force. This messages 
app should be able to do everything iMessage can do and more. I know it's 
in the developers to do this, especially with RCS technology getting into 
the hands of the carriers, it should be no time that we can have an Android 
iMessage that likely will work better. While right now this app only gets 
one star from me, i know it will be better in the future.",neg
 Awesome app,pos

(nothing that most other services don't already have) what is frustrating 
is to try and make suggestions and hear nothing. You can't share contacts 
and edit what you send. You can't schedule a text, you can't view media you 
have shared with a contact. Come on Google get in line with other services.",neg

The annoying ads each time I open the app to read or send a text is enough to offset any benefits. You can't apply a theme because instead of showing SMS themes, I'm forced to look at keyboard themes before I can install SMS themes. Honestly, it takes 3 times as long to send messages just be cause of the ads prior to opening g the application. Pathetic",neg

If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer. But you don't have that choice once they delete app. Its strange you want to make your money from add customers and not cuz of a quality product when you indeed have such. That's called greedy and not proud of your product. Don't be greedy and in time Your product will stand on its own with lots of customers and less adds. Number two issue is I have to stop to let the texting catch up. And I'm not even the fastest typer. Its very frustrating. If I'm excited or even angry and therefore passionate about what I'm texting to someone, I don't want to have to stop...wait...for...the...words...I...text...to...catch...up...get it? Number three, when I choose a theme, should it not over ride any background pic I formerly decided to choose? The theme pops up on the keyboard and the boarder of background wallpaper behind the messages but the pic I had chosen as my wallpaper prior to the theme remains. It looks choppy as they are nowhere close to being anything of the same topic. If I can't get this resolved I will not keep app as I'm all about the visuals. Last but not least, when I'm composing a msg, the keyboard stays on top of the msg. I cannot see what I'm typing. Why? I'm a terrible typed and must review what I'm composing. I shouldn't have to minimize the keyboard to do this. I have never had to do so until I added your app.",neg
