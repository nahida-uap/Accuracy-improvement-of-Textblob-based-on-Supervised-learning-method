" The worst thing now, are the new emojis, which not only are horrible, there 
is no way to switch them back to old ones. Everyone knows that the app is 
bulky, laggy and buggy, there is no need to write same things over and over 
again xD",neg
 Nice,pos

I downloaded this to try out texting (or typing, rather) from the desktop, but aside from just sending out a message to someone, this is completely useless. It takes a full 5 minutes to send or recieve a text, effectively ruining the ability to have a conversation in a reasonable amount of time. Will probably uninstall and try again at another time to see if this works better, this is what i get for getting my hopes up.",neg

 Not bad but very basic. Im finding it really hard to see the difference between a read and un-read message. Also how about a delay feature so the message can be written and then sent at a specific time later in the day.,neg

" This app is a load of garbage. Every time I try to type a long post, and scroll down, it takes me to the page where I make a post and completely erases everything I type. Then the ads at the bottom occasionally cover the bottom part of the text field above the keyboard and I cannot see what I type.",neg

thousands of photo editors on the Play Store. Of all that I've looked at, 
ToolWiz is the best. ToolWiz is powerful and I like the clean design of the

tutorials certainly help in this regard.",pos

randomly using camera when the actual app wasn't in use. It used it about 
12 times in one day without even opening the app. Creepy!",neg

There are lot features that can be use but still can't satisfy me and I need to use other apps for editing. Here are my suggestions: *Patch and healing - why not doing it multiple times with the same adjustments? I hate it adjusting again and again. *Face tune - use only demabrasion or whitening in manual, I hate erasing all the background. Face detection of skin may help. *Makeup - I need to use makeup app in order to beautify your face. Having different hair, eyebrows, eye lens, lips, countour and etc.. *Blending and Layer - must have perspective positioning the image for example I want to replace the image in the billboard. *Different brushes - use to paint and add effects just like in photoshop. Another thing, some tools doesn't have a tutorial. A lot of improvement and additional tools will be nice and hoping this will the best app to all that I dont need to use other. :)",pos
