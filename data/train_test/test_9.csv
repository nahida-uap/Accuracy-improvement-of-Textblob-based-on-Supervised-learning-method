It even has the best and loudest in-app video player I've seen in these kinds of app. That said, notifications are a bit delayed, which is why I always miss calls. I also still can't share links, photos, or videos from my newsfeed to labeled group chats. I'd have to tag each member one by one and even then, my post would still show up on a duplicate thread with our names as the default label instead of appearing on the already existing thread with the customized group name. Also, I wanna use night mode but it doesn't look too good in my opinion because of the design and colors used. Some stuff aren't even clearly visible. The notification light blinks too fast and too long in its current configuration as well. Lastly, I hope you make it faster and easier to switch accounts from the left side drawer, make it possible to more conveniently download photos in chat just by long-pressing the thumbnails instead of opening them one by one, and make a way for us to be able to download videos, especially from chat threads, not just the newsfeed. UPDATE: Working links/attachments posted by other people on chat threads don't appear anymore. I'm sure it's not because the links are dead or the attachments are unavailable/taken down already as I can see and open them just fine on Messenger Lite. That said, I checked the Facebook desktop site/view on my mobile browser (Chrome app) and I don't see the links/attachments either, while Facebook's mobile view on said browser doesn't let us view messages at all, as usual and forces us to install the app or switch to the desktop site. By the way, sometimes the bottom advertisements block the option/button to see all notifications. Closing them doesn't even work because that just replaces them with other targeted advertising.",pos
