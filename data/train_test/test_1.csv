The only things I wish you would add is the ability to upload more than one photo FROM my phone's gallery to Facebook, and to upload them directly to FB albums. This app only gives the option of uploading one photo to my wall or in a message.  Because of this flaw I must keep another app just for that purpose. Also, can't save/download photos. Update -12/10/17- I am still using the Metal app to upload multiple photos to my wall and directly to FB albums. It also uses less space than this ""lite"" app. You said I can upload more than one photo to Facebook FROM my phone's gallery, but this app does not show that option. When trying,  the only options are ""Wall"" or ""Message."" How do I do it? I now see I can save/download photos from FB, but it requires opening the photo in another window. That's 3 steps to save.
