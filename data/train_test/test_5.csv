" It's effective. Haven't used it for long though. The only thing I miss from 
my other messaging app is that it kept a side log of shared photos and 
links with other people. It was easy to go back and find images or any 
media shared/sent.",pos

It kinda seems like both are having issues. Sometimes messages are stuck in ""sending..."" other times pictures aren't transmitted properly. Then a lot of times it'll just fall back to sending ""SMS""/""MMS"" because the service seems down/disconnected?! Also Messages for web often doesn't show the ""SMS""/""MMS"" label but still sends it as one. That could become quite pricey for people without a flat rate. My provider is Vodafone in Germany. You really need to do something about this.    Original review: With RCS support Android Message is fit for the future. And the new web client makes it easy to read & respond to messages (either SMS, MMS or RCS) on other devices like a laptop or desktop PC.",neg
" Calling in messenger not working on data. As soon as I call someone or they 
call me the 4G LTE turns off. It only works on WiFi. Note 8 running Oreo",neg
" Although airtel has consented for the RCS support in india but still when i send message through wi-fi or data, i get deduction from my balance. it simply falls back to other messaging apps in a country like India where the data cost is Rs2.5/1Gb of data.",neg
 Awesome,pos
 This is great,pos
" This app is great! Just downloaded it today and I have already earned 68 minutes just doing these easy surveys. The question I do have though that seems to be unanswered, is: Do your minutes ever expire? Or do they stay until you use them?",pos

 I like this photo editer,pos
" Had to REDO this review, because it has major improvements, it is still 
improving but I would love an option that allows you to switch from low

 I linked this app,pos
" Works ok and is light on drive space, but lacks in a lot of features the actual Facebook messenger has. The advertisements cover up the emojis! And that is highly annoying and should be fixed and or just remove all ads all together. Any ad is a bad ad no one likes advertisements!!!",neg
 It gives another chance for move even if game gets over. Overall it's really good but except for ads..,pos
 Because my phone has insufficient space I use messenger n I don't regret it,pos

Totally works 100% legit,pos
" It was working great up until recently, it crashes, won't send messages, 
and will regularly stop working while I'm in the middle of a message after 
just opening the all. Force stopping it seems to alleviate some of the 
issues for a little while.",neg
+1 Good app,pos
" Works great, but I wish I could change backgrounds and colors like 
smasungs, but Samsung's texting app is busted but I'll be going back as 
soon as they fix it. If this app came out with custom backgrounds Id keep 
it.",pos
 Gooood,pos
" The app is simole and easy to use. It lacks any sort of customization, even 
a light/dark mode... It'd be nice to pin certain texts to the top as well.",neg
 Great features and easy to use!,pos
" 1. Pros : Simple text / MMS handling. Web app feature is good 2. Cons : 
'blocking' DOESN'T work. Multiple msg selection in same conversation 
doesn't work. Growing app size (52MB) is a nag. Needs some basic features 
fixed.",neg

with faster and better look on cell on pc or tablet. It seems the 
developers of the default messages app are way behind whatsapp or telegram 
or others. Replaced my novs plus with p20. Only to find out that it came as 
default messaging app and same no message schedule. More over the 
notification sound is the default notification sound and cannot be changed 
to a particular one different from that. It is a stupidity to say the 
least. Chomps sms has it both. So Textra. And so more others. Why on earth 
no one listen?",neg
 I like the apps just too many ads!,neg

 Phone app is good. But using the online app is a bit of a hassle. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.,neg

Have tried clearing cache, data, uninstalling, re-installing, restarting the phone and such, but no, it just hangs. No intermediate app-update, just stopped working. Am I the only one? All I get is a white screen and then nothing. Thought at first that it's an internet connectivity issue, found out when out and about, but same on mobile network, as well as on stable and rock solid WiFi at home.  Answer: Everything else works, web browsers, and official FB messenger app works, on my phone, can't say more than that. Everything else works on the app as well, just the loading of messages that don't. Currently using an old Samsung phone.  EDIT: If I go to ""Online Friends"", I can click on any of them, and from there I can access and use messages, specifically for that user, still not when clicking the general ""Messages"" however, that hangs as before.",neg
 Love how easy this makes it to create your own memes,pos
 This app is the best,pos
 I like that you dont have to download the fb messenger app.,pos
 Would have given the game 5 stars. But I have reached a score of over 1 200 000 only to have it reset to a mere 25 000. And this is not the first time my score gets reset. I see a few other users have the same issue. I hope the developer will offer a solution sooner.,neg
 Easy to use! :),pos
 Have so many effects and I love working with layers,pos

apps like this and they were bad this is the best one by far. If you ever

the phone as I though I would be. The app is about as good as the phone. It 
works, but could be better",pos
" Overall it's pretty decent. 2 things it's missing that it REALLY needs is 
1. Ability to pin contacts & 2. Schedule SMS. Both are needed in an update 
to make this a 5 star app.",neg

Forget it... Switching back. Not interested in bait and switch games.",neg
Showing adds I don't like apps that cover 1/3 of my screen with advertise on my expense (consuming my data plan) specially when there are similar apps which do exact same function. Developer better find another way to earn money,neg
