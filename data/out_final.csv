slow... sometimes the app is freezing and is impossible to type something. 
The app changes the notification sound by itself, just because it wants so 
and everytime it's a new notification sound. And the most interesting thing 
is that, this problems have only the Android users. My friends who have 
Samsungs, all of them have the described issues. I wouldn't use this app if 
it wouldn't be the only messenger connected to Facebook. I hope that in the 
future the things will change and this app will work properly."

running into problems loading and saving images sent to me from others. The 
odd thing is it only affects photos taken with phone cameras. If someone 
takes a photo and sends it to me, most of the time it won't want to load it

the image on my phone. Since one of the first updates that has caused this 
frustrating problem a few of my friend's camera photos have decided to be 
downloaded properly and display correctly on my device, but it still seems 
very luck based rather than anything and I haven't yet been able to find a 
solution. I'm also experiencing this problem with messenger lite."

list; it defaults to the messages history at the mo. And I use the Google 
handwriting input app which works with this 'Lite' app, but the input 
capture speed and accuracy both seem a bit reduced compared to some other 
apps. Of course being forced to write slower and do more like print than 
cursive, is probaby theraputic in my case so 5 stars is righteous."

It even has the best and loudest in-app video player I've seen in these kinds of app. That said, notifications are a bit delayed, which is why I always miss calls. I also still can't share links, photos, or videos from my newsfeed to labeled group chats. I'd have to tag each member one by one and even then, my post would still show up on a duplicate thread with our names as the default label instead of appearing on the already existing thread with the customized group name. Also, I wanna use night mode but it doesn't look too good in my opinion because of the design and colors used. Some stuff aren't even clearly visible. The notification light blinks too fast and too long in its current configuration as well. Lastly, I hope you make it faster and easier to switch accounts from the left side drawer, make it possible to more conveniently download photos in chat just by long-pressing the thumbnails instead of opening them one by one, and make a way for us to be able to download videos, especially from chat threads, not just the newsfeed. UPDATE: Working links/attachments posted by other people on chat threads don't appear anymore. I'm sure it's not because the links are dead or the attachments are unavailable/taken down already as I can see and open them just fine on Messenger Lite. That said, I checked the Facebook desktop site/view on my mobile browser (Chrome app) and I don't see the links/attachments either, while Facebook's mobile view on said browser doesn't let us view messages at all, as usual and forces us to install the app or switch to the desktop site. By the way, sometimes the bottom advertisements block the option/button to see all notifications. Closing them doesn't even work because that just replaces them with other targeted advertising."

2,"January 15, 2018", Anytime I tried to use the free wifi phone call feature- that didn't work. My message notufication would display 3 new messagea for 1 actual message. When trying to search for the help feature I got no results.

Have tried clearing cache, data, uninstalling, re-installing, restarting the phone and such, but no, it just hangs. No intermediate app-update, just stopped working. Am I the only one? All I get is a white screen and then nothing. Thought at first that it's an internet connectivity issue, found out when out and about, but same on mobile network, as well as on stable and rock solid WiFi at home.  Answer: Everything else works, web browsers, and official FB messenger app works, on my phone, can't say more than that. Everything else works on the app as well, just the loading of messages that don't. Currently using an old Samsung phone.  EDIT: If I go to ""Online Friends"", I can click on any of them, and from there I can access and use messages, specifically for that user, still not when clicking the general ""Messages"" however, that hangs as before."
3,"January 16, 2018"," Small filesize, easy to use, still lacks the ability to receive Instant Messages as Friends keep receiving a message my messenger is not able to receive instant messages.  Each time I open the app, Messages page keeps defaulting automatically."
4,"January 18, 2018", So far it works well on my Motorola the only thing that I would change is the friends request( people you might know) section I would totally eliminate that that's not necessary.

The only things I wish you would add is the ability to upload more than one photo FROM my phone's gallery to Facebook, and to upload them directly to FB albums. This app only gives the option of uploading one photo to my wall or in a message.  Because of this flaw I must keep another app just for that purpose. Also, can't save/download photos. Update -12/10/17- I am still using the Metal app to upload multiple photos to my wall and directly to FB albums. It also uses less space than this ""lite"" app. You said I can upload more than one photo to Facebook FROM my phone's gallery, but this app does not show that option. When trying,  the only options are ""Wall"" or ""Message."" How do I do it? I now see I can save/download photos from FB, but it requires opening the photo in another window. That's 3 steps to save. Also,  can't zoom/enlarge pages/photos?"

3,"December 18, 2017", Ive had this app for some years now then all of a sudden i cant delete my messages. The button for this option is completely gone. Idk if its because i have a galaxy 5 or if its glitch but i tried reinstalling it and still dont work
5,"January 3, 2018", I have only had Facebook Lite for a few days but so far I really like it.  It's not dragging my phone down with bloat ware or non stop advertising like the 'other' one.  It's easy to see where everything is. It's nice and simple just like me ....:)
5,"December 29, 2017", Update:  the app has been so glitchy since updating it.  I still like it though because it doesn't hog space like the official app  Facebook Messenger is a space hog and greedy on permissions so I don't use it.   I'm thankful for this little gem!
3,"December 19, 2017"," This app had been working great, but while better than the actual FB, I am now having issues. The 3 dots to get to edit takes me to a pull down menu, and trying to see who likes/loves takes me to friend requests."

3,"December 28, 2017", I would love this app. But banner ads over the text box? Tricking you into clicking. I really really do not appreciate that.
3,"December 31, 2017"," Great app in some respects, less bloated, more privacy and combined messenger and Facebook but there are glitches, can't press on certain things toward the top of the screen as they take you to the wrong places. I will happily rewrite this once those issues are sorted..."
4,"January 3, 2018", Does Facebook really well. Small install. Started having issues freezing.
4,"December 14, 2017", Good but a bit clunky sometimes. Nowhere near as bloated as the FB app though so the occasional quirks are forgiveable.
5,"January 5, 2018", I love this app so far... It's the way fb should be. There is no reason to have fb and messenger separated...so fkn stupid and annoying
5,"December 24, 2017", Pleased to be back after a break when i bought this a while ago. Bugs that bothered me have been fixed and this is back to being my main Facebook app
5,"January 28, 2018", I love this app. It's very reliable and easy to use.  Also i like the fact that you can download videos and save pictures. Also video takes a very short time to load which makes it better
3,"January 8, 2018"," Like that it doesn't take up too much space. I can make outgoing video and phone calls, but I can't receive them."
5,"January 14, 2018", Has turned out to be a very good app. Has issues on occasion like any other but is all in all much better than the alternative by far. Good work and thank you.

5,"December 21, 2017", So far this app is just like the Facebook for you app just less megabytes you can call you can text you can post everything that Facebook does you can do on this app even video calls
4,"December 18, 2017", The app takes a fairly long to refresh your messenger chat; alot faster to pull down the screen and refresh it yourself but it is annoying and something that I and most users aren't used to as it is usually refreshed every sec automatically.
5,"December 27, 2017", Love this app way better than the facebook one keep up the good work 10 stars from me :D
4,"December 14, 2017", I like this app because it works on my Android. Had problems with messenger.
5,"December 9, 2017", I can't call anyone but besides that I love Love love this app

5,"December 24, 2017", Is there a way to download videos people send in messenger? I'm not finding that option but thought it was there before.
4,"December 7, 2017", Why does it need permission to change system settings to enter the settings page of the app? Why the need for that permission in the first place?
5,"January 4, 2018"," the app. is fast, I love it, but then, there's no video call/group call, etc. features, hope you can update, thank you!"
4,"December 14, 2017"," I don't use Facebook to upload anything, so this lite version gives me what I want. It's fast."
5,"January 7, 2018"," It takes less space and is still very similar to the original. In some ways,I think it's better."
5,"January 1, 2018"," Great app, not perfect tho', but still much better than the official!"

I paid to remove ads. It's worth the price.  I like that I can configure it in ways the FB app can't. I got this mainly to allow me to use FB feed and Messenger messages in a single, clean, lightweight app that doesn't require me to restart my phone like Messenger did when I closed it.    Technically I could have left Messenger running before, but everything I did would crawl at a snail's pace (including typing) until I restarted my phone.  This app allows me to uninstall Messenger and still send/receive messages without issue now, with the added benefit of also browsing FB feed in the same GUI."
5,"November 20, 2017"," Had a problem with videos after the last update. Dev responded very quickly and advised how to resolve it. Normal service now resumed with this excellent app. I'd never use the native FB app in a million years, this app does everything required in a small, efficient package. Highly recommended."
3,"November 19, 2017", It's better than the beast that is the official FB App.  Apparently while using this app my Google Pixel is now a Lenovo Vibe S1 when Facebook sends me login notification emails. UPDATE: videos seem to auto play now where they didn't before. Cannot find a setting to turn this back off.

1,"October 24, 2017", Uploading a tiny photo file & it says I must keep it under 4 mb...... It's only 80k! Very unreliable.. I give up.. Deleted.
5,"November 1, 2017", This app is grate but there are alot of adds. It's everything you need in one app
5,"November 5, 2017", I can't download massager in my phone so I m very thankful they create this app thank you so much just what I been looking for :)
1,"October 28, 2017", There is no video call here. I cant see my husband....
4,"October 23, 2017"," Been using for a while now,even paid the small fee to remove ads. Video download option doesnt seem to be working again. Please fix. Thanks"
3,"October 29, 2017"," I like the app but I had to restrict the background data usage, because in last night it used about 3Gb of data without me even opening it."
1,"October 19, 2017", This app was great but it has bugs and it freezes. I have to sign in all the time. Way too much advertising.
4,"October 27, 2017", All i know is it kicks FB massagers butt.
4,"November 7, 2017"," I've installed and uninstalled several ""Lite Facebook & Messenger"" apps... This is the best one so far. I'm keeping it!"
5,"November 18, 2017", Good luck brother and sister this is the first time I have ever seen a good app and it is the only one I have to go to work tomorrow
5,"October 21, 2017", It takes less space than the Facebook & messenger. It does what I need while saving room for other apps
5,"October 17, 2017", Its great and saves space ever thing in one app love it I highly recommend
5,"November 1, 2017"," Compared to the resource hog that the official Facebook and Messenger apps are, this Lite version is awesome!"
4,"October 30, 2017", Best alternative to usual Facebook app that takes up so much space on my smart phone.
5,"November 7, 2017"," Nice lightweight alternative to Facebook and Facebook Messenger. Excellent UX, minimal ads and permissions, solid privacy policy."
5,"October 15, 2017", Very fast. I've purchased the upgrade to support you guy. Keep up the good job üëç
5,"October 29, 2017"," Simple, effective, much less memory used! Like it better than original fb and fb messenger apps!"
1,"November 14, 2017", Uploading video problem in messenger
4,"October 18, 2017"," Works with messages, removes suggested posts and friends you know. Not from Facebook. Pretty smooth. I approve."
5,"October 11, 2017", Love. Less data used means more apps I can download on my phone. :)
5,"October 18, 2017", Great app to replace the original Facebook app much smaller size to install. works great!!
4,"October 13, 2017"," Just started,  some smaller review  spots,  but ok"
5,"October 12, 2017", It is nice to have all the basic functions of fb with out all the used data. Thanks
5,"October 15, 2017", Awesome little app. Who needs the huge app when you got this one. Logic speaks for itself.
3,"November 3, 2017", This app usually for low phone
5,"October 30, 2017", I can't upload pictures
4,"November 1, 2017", It saves space for sure
5,"November 16, 2017", It does what it says it does!
4,"November 18, 2017", Like the little space used and being able to get the FB news
4,"November 14, 2017", All my devices

3,"October 29, 2017", Great ways 2 connect when needed!! It works  accordingly....
5,"October 13, 2017", Simple and easy to use. Doesn't use a lot of space. I love it.
5,"October 13, 2017", Very easy to use.   Don't like the ads!
4,"October 25, 2017", Great for using as a second account without memory drain
1,"October 11, 2017", Can't send photos to messenger any more.

3,"November 5, 2017"," Has a lot of bugs, yet lightweight and useful"

4,"October 8, 2017", I like how it effectively reintegrates facebook and messenger. That bugs me to no end they split it off. It also requires less permissions. Seems to work as a frontend to the full featude site. Pretty smart!
5,"October 6, 2017", It's approval ratings are as high as Donald J. Trump‚Äôs and Mike Pence. Love it!
2,"October 11, 2017"," Doesnt let you use page messenger (I.e., I cant pm assurance wireless, your app wont let me)."
3,"October 7, 2017", Still asking to download videos even when toggled off. Just let me play my videos on line as I could before.
5,"October 7, 2017", Works great! Simple and well written APP. KUDOS to developer.

It is how facebook used to be basically. Its got both the ability to mess around on a timeline and to message people. I haven't had an issue so far. I have never rated an app but if you guys are looking for something minimal that works this really is not bad. There are various features I just have not gone through them like I said I needed it for minimal use.
3,"October 3, 2017"," This app is better and worse than FB in a normal browser. Fixes updating status issue but will not allow desktop view so videos don't fit on the screen, which is a major issue. I find I usenit to write posts but not to read them."
5,"October 8, 2017", I love it I can chat with the other adults and girls that are my friends and family and not everyone else can see what you are saying to each other
4,"October 5, 2017", Scrolling bugged? Keeps scrolling up when I try to swipe downward.
4,"October 4, 2017", Uploading images and files in chats doesn't work anymore.
2,"October 7, 2017", Since my review was deleted here is anther one.DOWNLOAD and viewing images SUCKS on this app.

It's because it means it is a lightweight app. How much lighter? Messenger and Facebook combined is about 900mb, so let's round up to 1gb. Then, you have to take into account how ridiculous Facebook and messenger drain the battery and memory. This app starts at 20mb, and I'm currently at 69mb (storage increases as images, chat logs, etc. Go up. Aka cache.)  So, I highly recommend this app, this savior of our current decade while Facebook still exists."

4,"September 8, 2017"," The jury is still oot. So fair, so gud!  Update: Fix the problem with loading .gif files!! Also a few glitches, comments when posting from outside of Facebook don't show up!! Still better than bowing down to the Facebook corporation and installing their junk on my phone."
1,"November 7, 2017"," This app is a load of garbage. Every time I try to type a long post, and scroll down, it takes me to the page where I make a post and completely erases everything I type. Then the ads at the bottom occasionally cover the bottom part of the text field above the keyboard and I cannot see what I type."
4,"September 15, 2017"," The apps great, way less permissions and doesn't take up all your ram and possessing power 24/7. I'm having trouble tagging people, but editing the post seems to work every time. I'd like to see that fixed but besides that A1 app"

Still beats having to go to my laptop just to read messages. Thanks :)"

But this app does seems to access FB via the mobile site (which most do) which has problems with not being able to reliably turn off notifications for posts that you reply to.  I uninstalled the FB app when I saw I could turn notifications off on a post, but just noticed that the drop down on a post I want to silence only to see the option to turn notifications ON, rather than Off. I have noticed the drop down only works reliably on the desktop site.  I wonder what sort of down side there would be to simply pull from the regular desktop site, since I think FB not fixing the mobile site is one way they try to drive people to their app."
5,"September 17, 2017"," Love it. Besides the logout thing, this is perfect. Doesn't take up a lot of room. Talking about the logout thing its cool no one can use my phone for Facebook unless they exit twice. So sweet thanks!"
1,"September 8, 2017"," Phone kept playing random guitar and drum noises. Spent hours tracking down various video autoplay options, but still the same damn bass guitar and drums. Had to uninstall it."
5,"September 30, 2017", Love it everything Facebook with no glitches ram eating constant updates or nonsense the ads aren't intrusive either. Used it for a while now and never had issues unlike with the genuine Facebook apps
2,"September 15, 2017"," Uninstalling because... ""Add friends to see more stories"". The app stops you browsing your need feed until you hit 'Find friends now' button. The ads are bad enough but understand they pay the bills but what's the forced friend finding about?"
5,"September 20, 2017"," So far this is just as good, if not better then the actual facebook app itself. And soooo much smaller then the original app. Cant see myself switching back...."
1,"December 3, 2017"," It lets you not install Facebook messenger, but is buggy. Undismissable ads ruin videos, I get notifications when I send chat messages, and when I'm actively in the app. Ads taking away functionality feels like a forced upgrade and was the last straw. I was about to upgrade too. On to the next one."
5,"September 18, 2017"," So much better than the FB app; barely any permissions, but performs just as good if not better than the real thing... Highly recommended..."

5,"September 6, 2017", I like this app as it doesnt use much memory.   But the latest update doesnt bring up my 'show first favorites' and I need to go back to the real facebook app to see these items with ease.
1,"September 13, 2017", Had to uninstall because it keeps playing the same guitar music on loop even when the app is in the background  but the second I kill the processes it stops very frustrating
4,"September 16, 2017"," Works ok and is light on drive space, but lacks in a lot of features the actual Facebook messenger has. The advertisements cover up the emojis! And that is highly annoying and should be fixed and or just remove all ads all together. Any ad is a bad ad no one likes advertisements!!!"
1,"September 18, 2017", AVOID. tried as suggested by developers. Now it's locked on my phone and won't unistall but it removed the original fb app using the unistall from them in the store. Wow what a buggy program.....now I get to try and clean up this mess
4,"September 14, 2017"," For some reason the last word I put in reappears in the empty typing box and I have to clear it out,fix this and I will buy and promote this app"
3,"September 27, 2017", Only thing I didn't like was being asked multiple times to rate the app before I have a chance to use it and give fair review
5,"September 24, 2017"," I love it! Better than the regular facebook asking permission for everything before app is downloaded.  Easy and very simple to use! The Best app √©ver! Recommending to everyone I know... Plz no changes in the future, Thank u!"
3,"September 11, 2017"," It's OK. Some bugs in group chat uploading. Very slow to refresh, needs more live. I know it will get better"

5,"September 30, 2017", Love this app. Just a few bugs which I have reported but all in all much better than the official apps.

4,"September 1, 2017"," Takes up significantly less space than the official F'book app, but works just like it."
3,"September 1, 2017", App update constantly sends me notifications of messages I have despite having it disabled. I have messenger installed and don't need double notifications whenever I receive a message
3,"September 1, 2017"," Does what it's supposed to, but the messenger portion is clumsy."

5,"August 19, 2017"," This app is amazing. No more stupid messenger notifications and my day junk. And saving storage space is also a great bonus. Sure I can't video call or send gifs anymore, but that's a small price to pay for a phenomenal app! Keep it up developers!"
4,"August 20, 2017"," Since latest update it will allow me to type messages, comments but will not allow me to send or post which pretty annoying because I got this so I didn't have downloaded the huge RAM eating messenger. In the past I really liked it but now it is not functioning properly"

Also, it's frustrating when trying to go back to a post that the app resets the feed and does not take you back to the post you were viewing. Also when opening replies to comments, if I use the back button, I end up back at the original post, then have to go back to the comments and try to find where I was. ...   ...   ...         Love that I can access my messages from within the app.  Far better than the original FB app.  Thank you Developers."

It's similar to FBPurity for desktop browsers in that it cuts the garbage out of FB, just leaving the stuff you want.  Still not perfect though. Eg. The See More Memories button doesn't work and scrolling through photos is a pain. Great work devs, keep it up!"
2,"August 7, 2017"," I paid for the ad free app and it has been glitchy ever since.  Videos don't go full screen at the correct ratio, it isn't loading photo comments, the Facebook gif feature doesn't work. Very frustrating to pay for an app and have it basically stop working."
1,"August 26, 2017"," This app sucks. Most of the time it doesnt even work correctly. Wont load, or wont post statuses, pictures or comments. Have been having these issues for several weeks."
5,"August 21, 2017"," It doesn't lag the heck out of my phone like the original Fb apps. After disabling them both then installing this, I can say my phone runs much more smoother. I'll take that any day"
3,"August 10, 2017", Like this app as it is a lot smaller than the original but it won't let me check-in It says I have to turn on my location first but it is on so have to use another app to check-in which is annoying .I emailed the developer but got no reply.
5,"August 26, 2017", I love this version of messenger.  For some reason I can't install Facebook messenger anymore. It will download but after 15 minutes or more of waiting for it to install I gave up.
1,"August 11, 2017", Dude seriously could you make this damn app any more complicated??? I'm forced to login every single time and there's no one click option. Then it says something about have to close twice before logging back in. What the hell do you even mean by clothes twice??? Uninstalling!!!!!!!
4,"August 5, 2017"," Way better than the actual FB app. I don't need two apps for everything and I have room left over on my phone. So what are the ads when you get them with the actual app, just in a different way"
5,"August 6, 2017"," Excellent app that is light weight and non invasive compared to the full blown full facebook app, And still pretty much fully functional. I can view facebook & message people and send stickers and what ever."
5,"August 16, 2017"," Good. But still wish there was a way too sign out, instead of dumping data to log yourself out. Kinda of a pain in the butt BIG TIME!!!!"
4,"August 3, 2017", Seems ok.  Changed because official app not working.. Have shared on my wall like said but still adverts at bottom though
5,"July 30, 2017", Badass freed up 1 gb worth of space.. Got rid of both Facebook and messenger huge need for data. A+ App
5,"August 27, 2017"," It does what it says and works fine. A lot lighter, faster, and smoother than Facebook's own behemoth data gobbler. Ads are down at the bottom and don't get in the way."
5,"August 26, 2017"," Only just reinstalled this, glad to see the payment op is now working to get rid of the adverts.  Very good takes up less room on your phone  Recommended"
3,"August 21, 2017", My GBoard is still dropping and won't go back up unless I tap multiple times. Otherwise I love it. Great replacement for Messenger.
3,"August 11, 2017", Won't let me send a photo. I have tried several times and it just will not send.
5,"August 20, 2017", Lighter on the battery and better than Facebook ... and slightly quicker to notify - still got both whilst I test it - and with an inbuilt messenger. What more can I ask.
4,"August 20, 2017"," After a recent factory reset of my phone,  the official Facebook and messenger app wouldn't work at all so this has been a godsend.  Thank you."
5,"August 4, 2017", after sharing/writing a post please let us resume browsing on the feed instead of returning to the top... aka resetting the feed
5,"August 1, 2017", I was having problems with the fb app and now I don't with this wonderful app.
5,"August 1, 2017", Bhout acha app hai messenger download karne nhi padega aur v Facebook lite surf isko kar lo.
5,"August 26, 2017", so much better than the bloated FB app with its seperate messenger app you are forced to install
5,"August 3, 2017", It's really lite. Fully featured. It does drain battery a tad bit in the background. But overall it's swell
5,"August 22, 2017", Best app ever my phone has little to no storage space with this app I can now run updates
2,"August 13, 2017", After the app updated it started crashing when I open it and I reinstalled it too but it didn't help.
3,"August 21, 2017"," When default is set to ""open to newsfeed"", and the default newsfeed is set to ""top stories"", it still opens as ""most recent"" instead. Please fix for 5 stars."
3,"August 17, 2017"," Having issues opening in Webview, still overheats my phone due to memory bloat but more manageable... Help?"
5,"August 14, 2017", Facebook messenger and social posting app for around 40 MB instead of 600 MB. Yeah this app much better than the official one.
5,"August 23, 2017"," Smaller space required and no more notification , love it"
3,"August 13, 2017"," Only downloaded for the use of sending photos and it cant even do that, just gives an error msg every time"
3,"August 13, 2017"," It would be better if it had colored backgrounds,  gif features,  my day,  etc.  Otherwise it's a decent app"
1,"December 3, 2017", Worst bloody app I've ever used too many ads and it doesn't even work properly
4,"August 2, 2017", A lot less of a resource hog than fb
2,"August 14, 2017", Not Good. This app & facebook web browsing are same. Not stra future.
5,"August 17, 2017"," Best messenger alternative and most reliable one I've used. But chat heads would be very nice to have integrated. Other than that, very good."
5,"August 12, 2017", This app is so much more convenient than regular Facebook. I love it. A gotta have.
5,"July 30, 2017"," I needed an app this small to replace messenger and FB mobile, and this is perfect"
5,"July 29, 2017", Great app..hoping for more developed.. I mean upgrade..
1,"August 4, 2017", Foolish app. plez dnt dwnld
4,"July 28, 2017","Lite version of FB Good app needs small improvements, but good app"
2,"August 23, 2017", I can only view 3 post on fb when i scroll down i get only the same 3 post
5,"August 23, 2017", By far the best messenger app the only downside is no Facebook calling
4,"August 29, 2017"," Good app,uses less data but sometimes won't hook up app levels,fix this problem and it would be better"
4,"August 17, 2017"," Im undecided about this app,  however it does seem much simpler than the two separate fb and messenger apps."
5,"July 28, 2017"," Great app, so far no problems."
4,"August 1, 2017", Great app. Takes up a lot less space than Facebook.
4,"August 10, 2017", Works good and unlike Facebook messenger it doesn't overload my phone with emojis and lock me out of my own phone !!
5,"August 5, 2017", I love it except for no video calling In messenger.
4,"August 14, 2017", Works and does not hog memory on your phone for FB!
5,"August 11, 2017", Great app takes less space than fb app so great for smart phones with not much space
5,"July 29, 2017", it's amazing it helps to ignore people üòÇüòÇ
4,"August 27, 2017", It should be able to call not just video call
5,"August 23, 2017", Muy bueno. Estaba exceptica al principio pero funciona excelente.
5,"August 5, 2017", It's ok I can't really complain I have messenger and facebook all in one
4,"August 17, 2017"," For the last month or so, photos in comments are rarely uploaded. Otherwise, great"
5,"August 26, 2017", Lot better than fb app
1,"July 31, 2017", Slowest app I've ever seen.
4,"August 15, 2017", Good..but I hate the ads
5,"August 31, 2017", I've loved every moment of it. Best alternative to Facebook there is honestly.
1,"August 24, 2017", Way to many glitches
4,"July 30, 2017", So far it has been a great experience.  Truly lite weight.
5,"August 13, 2017", I like it better everything is on one app facebook and messenger.
5,"August 15, 2017"," I think it's cool, but don't like the ads"
5,"August 16, 2017"," Excellent, non intrusive native app alternative!"
5,"August 13, 2017"," 10,000x better and faster, also not a resource hog!!!"
5,"August 29, 2017", Saves space on my smart phone compared to messenger.
5,"August 15, 2017", Awesome app. It's everything it promises
4,"August 19, 2017", Love so far on day 1!
5,"August 10, 2017", Great app.... Excellent lightweight replacement.

5,"July 29, 2017", I had nothing but trouble with Facebook kept flashing and i couldnt install. Facebook lite never crashes and stays on!! Well done!
2,"July 27, 2017"," Really slow and laggy for me... Feels bogged down, like a 2000s Flash website. It doesn't ""just work"" - notifications don't clear, takes a few seconds for my keyboard to pop up, bounces around between views or conversation progression. App never opens in the same place twice. Next!"
4,"July 28, 2017", Less ram usage make the mobile smoothly go...but Bad part is I cannot share anytype of images to other platforms as Instagram etc.. Please fix
4,"July 28, 2017", Need some improvements bit slow freeze and lags sometimes as well and most important notifications delay . Ignoring all this overall is Good . Thumbs upüëç
4,"July 29, 2017"," Takes what Facebook used to be before the messenger split,  and puts it all back together in a smooth application that WORKS.  CODING IS DONE RIGHT."
4,"July 27, 2017", Would like the option to share to custom chat rooms/group messages.  Great app!
5,"July 27, 2017", So far fantastic

Besides this iys a perfect app.  Already tried close and reopen.whenever i tap to remove ads i still get the same message to share on wall and tap on it again.
3,"July 25, 2017", Maximum time it is showing 'add friends to see more stories' in my timeline instead of posts. Please do something. Btw I have many friends in FB
5,"July 25, 2017"," Great replacement app for Facebook and messenger, no problems I've run into yet."
3,"August 6, 2017"," Voice & video call feature for lower versions must be added. It'll be better if chat heads can be added. otherwise, this is a perfect app"
5,"July 26, 2017", Too early  but so far ok
3,"July 25, 2017", It won't notify me of messages
5,"July 26, 2017", Simple FB layout. Great way to use messenger. Way better than the messenger app.

5,"July 20, 2017", Much better than messenger. I'm parinoid messenger records constantly when I'm not using it. Why else would a app need to be 90mbs+ ??!! After Snowden dropped the truth I don't trust facebook anymore. This app is the way to go.
4,"July 21, 2017", I really like the app so far work fast but only isuue when you launch app always messaging page comes why not news feed? Which is annoying me please fix
4,"July 14, 2017"," Very light, best alternative to heavy FB app. But it doesn't keep the position of my last visit and it often asks me to login again cuz it logs out alone, both of these things are annoying"
3,"July 15, 2017"," A decent, simple and useful app. Recently though it has been sending me notifications not just of messages that have been sent to me but also now it's notifying me of my own messages. This is annoying."
4,"July 12, 2017"," Space saver. 3.65 MB vs real FB messenger's 117 MB. Haven't noticed any glitches or seen any pop-up ads. Only problem, is it doesn't link to FB account's messenger button. Have to leave FB and go directly to app to read/send messages."
5,"July 20, 2017", Great app. I can upload 30 pics easily. Tagging never be this easy. Voice call quality is exceptional. I love how I can scroll the newsfeed smoothly and go to Messenger part quickly. This is the only wrapper that works for me!! Highly recommend!!!
4,"July 12, 2017", Getting use to the app. The only bad thing is trying to post from ur memories or message is hard to figure out. Other than that it's nice
5,"July 11, 2017", Pretty good alternative. Its size is small not like the original app just need some improvements and it's good!
4,"July 11, 2017"," Trying this app again. So far so good, if the notifications remain reliable, I'll keep it as my only fb app."
4,"July 18, 2017"," Hay seems ok so far BUT on my galaxy S5 in post for photo, it won't show CAMERA to take photo only gallery. My friends OPPO phone does. And could it be shown when uploading pics etc can there be a progress bar with % to show progress?"
2,"July 17, 2017", Woke up this morning to be notified on this app i was now friends with a ransom stranger. I didnt send a friends request nor did i recieve one. Needlees to say i logged out n uninstalled the app. I will not be using this app again. Not trustworthy.
5,"July 22, 2017", I disabled Facebook because it was taking up too much space and my messenger app never worked. This app has basically everything Facebook does and I can actually send and receive messages now! Great app :)
5,"July 17, 2017", Need to improvement ... Improve speed of app...its too lazyy. So slow..
4,"October 9, 2017"," This app works well as a replacement for messenger, but randomly shows up in connected devices as Windows PC"
4,"July 15, 2017", why you guys not working on gifs ? overall the app is very good except that it doesn't play gifs. We have to open gif in other browser. Work on it so that we can see gifs in this application itself.
1,"July 13, 2017", It saves data because everything takes longer to load when not in WiFi. I just wanted messenger not news feed. If you disable pictures you can't tell who's talking in a group chat.
2,"July 24, 2017", Was my favorite app. Now I can't post status on Facebook. I click upload pic and after I select the photo it reloads to the Messages page. Please fix (Samsung On5)
2,"July 9, 2017", It was great until the Trending page stopped working it been almost 4 months fix it
1,"July 14, 2017",Awful Can't even post any pics now..
3,"July 11, 2017",Where's the video call? I give 5 star if you will tell me how to use video call!?
5,"July 22, 2017", This app is way better than installing Facebook and Facebook Messenger it's everything on 1 for a smaller hard drive space I would recommend all Android users to use this app
4,"July 22, 2017", I think ye acha hai main FB se Kum jagha leta hai but kabhi kabhi isme text format bigadh jata hai so wese acha hai main FB unsorted hota tha ye nhi hota
3,"July 11, 2017", I rate it 3 star coz it doesn't support writing from right to left like Arabic or Hebrew
3,"July 14, 2017"," App has bugs like Fullscreen video zooms way too much, notification icon vanishing etc."
4,"July 20, 2017"," Generally OK,I dislike the ads bar at the bottom."
5,"July 14, 2017", It's very easy to use. All features provided in this app is very good.
5,"July 17, 2017"," Ilovethis....but so slow for my phone,pls fix for meüò¢"
5,"July 13, 2017", Finally got both of them together . No one should have to download the apps separate again
4,"July 11, 2017", This app is very good for news feed and chat....but should be messenger lite as a fb messenger for chatting and emoji... then will be more better
5,"July 9, 2017", I think this apps is good co'z no need to download it one by one together in one is better .
5,"July 16, 2017", Great app! Just wish I was able to go on the market like normal facebook
5,"July 13, 2017", Great uses so little memory and switches from FB to messenger effortlessly. I recommend it for everyone especially the person with no sd card.
5,"July 17, 2017", Please remove ads then it will be the finest Facebook app.
5,"July 11, 2017", If Messaging good... Then whole app will be in good place... Messages are arriving Very slowly
4,"July 26, 2017"," Only been using the app a short time, so far I'm very happy with it's performance. Delivers on all it's promises."

4,"July 18, 2017"," Very good, but Vibration function on notifications and messages is not working for me. Please fix it. :)"
1,"July 22, 2017", why do we need to install another messenger app to send messages?
5,"July 11, 2017", I dnt knew because I dnt try out the GIF and voicemail yet.

Only a couple of small complaints which is why I'm giving it four instead of five stars....I can't send a new message to anyone on my list because it tells me to download messenger and I can't upload a picture straight from my gallery because it tells me I don't have permission. I may just be doing something wrong. Overall excellent app that works great if you need to save space!
5,"July 5, 2017"," Edit from my last review, developer told me to download the beta version of the app to fix some issues, and it did in fact work. Using the @ sign followed by the users name to tag them is the answer! Thank you for the reply!"
5,"July 1, 2017"," I like it! It works fast connects well, and is very easy to use."

Around three years ago it was perfectly fine when Facebook supported the OS with the full versions of Facebook and Messenger. Now it's impossible to comment without half the post missing for some strange unknown reason, and messages send without pressing the send button. Far too frustrating to be usable on mini phones with Android 4.2."
4,"June 29, 2017"," This app is what the official Facebook and Messenger should be. Fully Working, Does Everything as it should minus all of the bloatware BS and kids stuff that's included in the official apps. I give this app 4.8 stars!"
5,"June 27, 2017", Great after removing the stock Facebook app and switching to this  with the 1 dollar purchase my battery life sky rocketed 6 more hrs on my Nexus 5x and phone is definitely more responsive highly recommend this with the 1 dollar to remove ads

4,"May 21, 2017"," Love that this takes up so much less space on my phone! Works well, and is easy to figure out. Does some things I can't just by using FB on my browser. My only complaint is that I wish I could access the marketplace! But that's minor."
2,"June 23, 2017", For just looking at fb or commenting it's good but I added it for the messenger and it does not give me any notifications if someone fb messages.  How do I know I ued my hubbies phone to snd me a message didnt notify me. But another app I use on my tablet did so not what I added it 4.
3,"May 15, 2017", Came back to app. Can now view comments and image uploads has an option to use FB app for faster uploads. Request... Would like to share a post and type in a friend's name (mention) for post without tagging them. Not sure if that's a feature only available for native FB app.
5,"May 11, 2017"," UPDATE: Just Bought It! 99cents is a steal. Nimble, fast, lite on the background data usage and not a bloated obese gorilla like the official FB. Good on phones, and it's simply terrific on a tablet. Suck it up and purchase, tight wad this is worth it."
4,"May 28, 2017", Its works good and is very practical idk why facebook requires 2 apps in the first place and why its so freaking big. One thing I realy dont like though is the 4k picture of venice that's fake but also it lags a lot
3,"May 31, 2017"," I really like this app... when it isn't taking 40 years to load a page. I thought this was supposed to be ""lite"" - shouldn't these issues be virtually non-existent?   Also, it sucks when it freezes and after a minute, sends you back to your messages"
5,"July 6, 2017"," Simply the best Facebook app around. Was sick of having  Messenger  and Facebook as huge battery drainers. A mere 6 mb, no major energy drain, and it is slicker and more versatile than FB on browser. Absolutely love it."
1,"May 26, 2017", This app sucks Do not waste ur time. It would not log me into fb. It has too many adds and DO NOT DO IT!!IT IS HORRIBLE!!!
5,"May 11, 2017"," Very small footprint. Lighter on data, battery and memory. Much better than the bloatware Facebook puts out!  Messaging in the same app again. Definitely worth the $1 to remove ads.  AWESOME APP.     THANKS!  I CAN USE FACEBOOK AGAIN WITHOUT KILLING MY BATTERY..."
5,"June 22, 2017", I give it 4.8 because no real big complaints. Runs smoothly and I have a Moto Android (dinosaur phone)... I just would like sound options for hearing when like somebody messages you for instance.
3,"May 22, 2017", This is a very good app.  Still it has few issues (eg. Muting facebook group chats) Please fix these bugs. Thank you for making such a great alternative!
3,"May 20, 2017"," Decent, but clumsy. Too many push notifications, and no quick way to disable them per guidelines upon their receipt.   Handy alternative to messenger, but viewing the Facebook website is still easiest for general use."
4,"May 9, 2017"," Loved it. Light and let's me do anything, including share to page and group. 1000x better than the original. Only issue is it does not let me take pictures instantly from the post box, only from the gallery of pictures taken."

If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer. But you don't have that choice once they delete app. Its strange you want to make your money from add customers and not cuz of a quality product when you indeed have such. That's called greedy and not proud of your product. Don't be greedy and in time Your product will stand on its own with lots of customers and less adds. Number two issue is I have to stop to let the texting catch up. And I'm not even the fastest typer. Its very frustrating. If I'm excited or even angry and therefore passionate about what I'm texting to someone, I don't want to have to stop...wait...for...the...words...I...text...to...catch...up...get it? Number three, when I choose a theme, should it not over ride any background pic I formerly decided to choose? The theme pops up on the keyboard and the boarder of background wallpaper behind the messages but the pic I had chosen as my wallpaper prior to the theme remains. It looks choppy as they are nowhere close to being anything of the same topic. If I can't get this resolved I will not keep app as I'm all about the visuals. Last but not least, when I'm composing a msg, the keyboard stays on top of the msg. I cannot see what I'm typing. Why? I'm a terrible typed and must review what I'm composing. I shouldn't have to minimize the keyboard to do this. I have never had to do so until I added your app."

in the developers to do this, especially with RCS technology getting into

horrible and not working correctly!!! It is constantly freezing up and

down my throat through Facebook messages. That was until I switched from 
iOS to Android and found that the native messaging application was 
extremely limited. My messages take 5-10 min to show up which becomes 
especially frustrating when you're waiting on a temporary sign-in key. I'm 
sure my carrier has something to do with my speed of service but a ""chat"" 
function usually relies on cell data or wifi (which I'm on 90% of my life). 
I don't see this as an option with Android messages. I tried out the 
desktop sync and it's just a mirror of the phone app. Messenger isn't a 
perfect substitute either because it is too easy to get Facebook originated 
messages confused with your SMS and your notifications become useless. 
These are the options I have for default messaging on my Motorola G5. I've 
tried using other apps that aren't set to default but its not possible to 
completely ditch a native text app. Especially when your real phone number 
tied to a known device is required for verification purposes. Im tired of 
trying to explain Google voice to my mother and most other messaging apps 
require that the recipient also use the application. I think enabling a

many questions."
1,"December 24, 2017", Absolutely useless. I opened and placed the number I want to call and placed what number it'll show. It went along and called some weird number that i didn't even input. And I had 4 free minutes and they were gone in less than 10 seconds. This app is terrible.

1,"April 11, 2018", What kind of scam are you trying to pull?  I select 30min @ 4.00 and get charged 4.20 If you list price as 4.00 you charge 4.00 not 4.20 and it has nothing to do with tax or otherwise as no tax is charged on a purchase so do not try to shoot me some garbage stating that.

Whenever i press ""call"" , the number changes to a completely different and invalid number. I know that the 'different number' is to get connected to your servers.

So it doesnt get connected to your servers and i cant use it to prank my friends."
4,"August 24, 2017"," Perfect apart from one thing: SMS messaging. I would love to send texts such as ""Thank you for signing up to Random Fact of the Day! You will receive a general fact every day at 12 PM for only ¬£8.99 monthly!"". Apart from that, amazing app!"

1,"October 8, 2017", This is worse App I have ever used. It wants email address then bombards you with shite and junk. Once installed it doesn't even work. Do not download. Reported to Google
1,"September 6, 2017", This application is used to intimidate and harass people. I know of someone using it for that purpose and this company has absolutely no shame in allowing this to continue. There is no way to report abuse of this application and they appear to do nothing about it.
5,"August 23, 2017",Love it Was a great tool that helped me see who was real and who was not!! Just the surveys for adding minutes gets a little annoying especially when your 5-10 minutes into and survey stops and yellow receive one minute for all that

Also, to any negative reviews on this app, they clearly do not know how a service works and do not know how calls work. The app is NOT A scam, the company do not do ANYTHING with your email."

recommendation for the app developer or developers if possible to do an 
update to where not to much ad pop ups but also I don't know if you guys 
also know that the ad's are like as a separate app of its own. Reason for 
me to say that is because when I kill task for any and all apps that are 
open the ad's is it's own window and it also has the little x in the right 
corner of it to weather if you want to close it or keep it open and 
running. Just to let you guys know if you wasn't already aware of it."
5,"June 4, 2018"," Totally addictive. Its not just about matching numbers as they happen. You 
have to make moves to get the numbers where you can match them without 
filling up the board too fast. There's a kind of Rubbicks cube element to 
that for me. Enjoy!"

than that.. Try to achieve greater numbers.... Do you all know this.....???

1,"January 12, 2018", What a load of rubbish god only knows how this game works. I saw so many great reviews so decided to try. Tip to you... Don't bother
4,"May 9, 2018"," Please move the start over button. I have hit that so many times when just 
trying to undo a move. At least add a confirmation popup"
5,"March 17, 2018", It's so fun and addictive!!  But the game is never ending if you use the 9x9 tiles haha thank you for such an awesome game!
2,"June 7, 2018"," I'm very sad with the fact that my game was blown due to the fact that 
clicking on settings buttom during the game leaves the game and just saves 
the actual score. Really, really sad. Unless you call retrieve my game, I'm 
gonna have this game removed from my phone."
1,"July 5, 2018"," I hit that after a lot of effort i clicked by mistake on reset and it 
immediately reseted the game It didn't show any message and i couldn't undo 
that. I would never play that again"

game then come back to it"
3,"July 5, 2018"," Love the 2048 games, however this one seems a little glitchy, I push left 
and it goes right, up it goes down, left it goes up, you get what I'm 
saying. It works sometimes but not often enough"
5,"December 27, 2017", This game is very addicting  once you play your 1st time your mind will be stuck to it
4,"December 22, 2017", Hi there i love the game but one of my kids accidently bought the no ad 99p purchase i was wondering if you could refund that?

3,"December 11, 2015",RAM eater It's a great game and playing on a 6x6 board is Zen-like but for such a simple game it eats battery like no other. I just about can't play unless I'm either plugged in or I accept my phone's premature death.
3,"August 30, 2016",Too easy It's fun but there is no challenge. I'm watching TV playing this without really trying and I got whatever 2048 times 16 is.

3,"January 18, 2017", I downloaded a few days ago and still playing my first game. There is no end and it's not challenging at all. I prefer the original 2048.  I do hate how slow the tiles move. I feel like I'm playing in slow motion and falling asleep while doing it.
5,"October 21, 2016","Great stress-reliever Whenever I have a tough situation going on, I automatically go to this. It helps me think subconsciously about a problem and I am then quickly able to find a solution. Thanks so much for making this app! Would love a response."

2,"June 30, 2016",Okay It takes up very little space but the only catch is that its never-ending. I've been playing for a good week and my score is 709528. So it's not challenging at all.
3,"May 9, 2016","Addictive, but... ...surprisingly easy! Compared to the original game it's ridiculous - on my first ever game playing this I ended up with 131072...as well as a couple of 2048s, 4096s and 8192s on the same board. Ridiculously addictive but no challenge!"
5,"December 5, 2016",Dont Panic Update of this swapped the app icon between 2048 and 2048+  Thought I had lost my million tile. Still there though...phew. Great time passing app that needs a bit of tactics.
4,"December 16, 2015",Awesome!! But.. Its was really an awesome game untull I realised that I just have to swipe up-right-down-left over and over a 1000 times to reach the 4096th tile. Try making it a bit difficult.
2,"January 26, 2016",Misses key part of game Although the large grid is fun. The new tiles continue to be small numbers. This means unless you like 4 month games you will find this glacially slow compared to original 2048.
4,"October 5, 2016","Good for distraction The big board is far to easy but it is stupidly addictive. I got to 77k before I got bored of trying to lose. However, I have started the 4x4 board and it's much more challenging and enjoyable"
3,"May 9, 2016"," I used to just play 2084 and found that challenging and decided to challenge myself some more. This however is not the answer. After playing off and on for a few days now, I already at a unbelievable high score. Great time to kill time but honestly it's not worth it."
5,"November 12, 2016","Just reach my 2 million tiles. I think I waste too much time on these endless additive game, just reach my 2 million tiles, time to stop.  What is the point to confirm a backup!"
5,"November 7, 2016","I didn't think it'd be this good! It's simple, challenging but easy all in one. It has multiple themes to choose from to make your game experience more personalized and fun!"
4,"January 28, 2017"," Most of the time it is too easy but once you stack up enough of the yellow and lilac pieces it has some challenge. I would wish for a scoreboard, played the game once and stopped at some 6 point something millions, it would be nice to know how that compares to the rest of the players."
5,"August 30, 2016", Awesome way to kill some time. I always leave it and continue the same game next time I'm a bit bored. My biggest tile is now 65 536. Wanna see the colour of the next one up... (update: it was blue)
3,"March 21, 2016","Fun to change game size but... A larger board just makes the game easier. The most challenging is 3x3, but it's nearly impossible because it clogs so fast. The best balance between possible and difficult is 4x4, but that's the original game. 3 stars for trying something new, but the new features don't do much for the game."
5,"March 25, 2017", How did it restart by mistake and I can't hit undo to get back to my previous game? I lost weeks worth of work twice recently.

4,"November 7, 2016",Its good It would be cool if this game updated and there were levels. If there were levels it wud be less boring and more of a compotition. Give a thumbs up if people think its a good idea

I was hoping for a more challenging twist on the game. Unfortunately that is not the case. 2048 Plus has a 6x6 grid instead of 4x4, but is otherwise the same. The larger grid means it is much easier to play, and much more forgiving. My very first game I got the 16384 tile without ever feeling challenged. The fame may get more challenging, but it takes too much time to get to that point."
5,"January 29, 2016"," Love the game been playing for quite some time and have a 1 MIL block, the option to change the background doesn't work for me. Can only use the default sky with clouds."
4,"June 9, 2016","Additictive! Even though it took forever, my first game ever ended with 137,808 points.  To win you need 2,048.. I'd say I did good lol. Will keep this app for when I'm bored."
5,"February 14, 2016", If there's a leader board I cant find it and if there isnt one then there should be. I've been playing the same game for two weeks and itd be cool to see if anyone else is as crazy
5,"January 9, 2017", My wife was watching me play this yesterday and she said she didn't really get the appeal of this game. I said that it's really not so much a game as it is meditation. She got it then.

1,"March 6, 2018", I'm believably boring. I went in a square pattern for hours and got to 1600s without trying or having to think. Don't waste your time.

2,"May 14, 2016",DON'T PLAY IF A BOY! I was SO shocked to see a period pad pop up as an add. My younger brother played this and asked me what it was!
5,"July 3, 2016",Addicting :-) I've been playing the same 8√ó8 game since late Jan. I'm wondering just how high the tiles go and looking forward to finding out!
3,"March 31, 2016",I have no interest anymore I reached the 4096 just in one go ! It is sooo easy and boring so i lost interest
4,"January 9, 2016",Think its riged I think its riged because on my first game i got the high score 74892 and i won. Then i finally lost after 45 minutes. I think its designed so that its way harder to lose.
5,"February 5, 2017"," If you like 2048, you will love the additional flexibility of this game. 8 undos, your own colour scheme (though fine control is tough in the colour chooser). Excellent game, no pressure. Have been playing it for years."

time waster and it helps me fall asleep."

5,"January 10, 2016", Very well done lots of fun. Way to easy though. Bigger board gives more moves and the game is very easy to beat
3,"February 4, 2016",Easy It says that it's more challenging than the original but on my first game I reached an 8192 tile.

Its a game that goes on so long that, when you lose, you will more than likely never want to play it again because of all the time you put into it.  That said however, my first (and definetly last) game is very entertaining! Try it!"

5,"July 26, 2015","Love this. Just wandering... What's the highest score someone has gotten? I've played for over a week straight, several hours each day and finally just lost my first game with a 131,702 tile with just under 3 million points."
3,"January 13, 2015", My score in this game 2173128 in 6√ó6 mode it sooo easy to make 2048 in this game. I also got 131072 in this game but it have some problem it doesn't have leaderboard to show my score to the world.
2,"April 5, 2015",Too easy and drains battery 8x8 grid is way too easy... Been on my 2nd game for days... Over 5.5 million  points and not in any danger of losing.  Drains my battery way too fast.  Phone gets hot after 5 minutes!

4,"May 31, 2015",Getting used to it. No matter how bad you are there is always a way to continue to score. I'm  getting bored with it. Great game for those who don't want too much challenge. Still no challenge but am playing with it.

My only suggestion is to make the undo option have the ability to go back more than one swipe.  The board is so large that it requires rapid swipes.  So what often occurs is that you may errant swipe the opposite direction that you intend then immediately swipe again, essentially ruining your game in a split second. So far for me, every game for me has ended this way. Very frustrating. . Still fun though!"
5,"July 3, 2015","1 time score I was just wondering how everyone did there 1st time playing. I went past the game ending requirement of 2048 to see how far I could go. My highest tile was 16,384, with a score of just over 390,000. I would love to see others scores and max tiles."
1,"January 6, 2015","6x6 game is stupid Too easy to win, near impossible to lose. This game is pointless, I regret downloading it. I'm still on my first game with a 32768 tile and now I'm getting rid of the game because I fear I will waste my life playing it."

I think it might be impossible to lose on 6x6, but I can't stop playing. I haven't even tried the other game modes because I'm worried it will erase my 6x6 game."
5,"March 3, 2018"," Does updating the app affect the current game? I'm at 2097152 and close to being able to double that. Also, need to undo more than once. Sometimes the screen is too sensitive and I'll hit two moves unintentionally and it messes up my pattern and it takes days to fix it."
2,"March 19, 2015",No challenge 4096 was easy to obtain in original game without undo one in three games or 100% of the time with undo. This game is easy to get 6 digit tiles and still on first game. Impossible to lose.

5,"October 21, 2015",Endless Some say it ruins the achievement of high score but I think its quite nice to be able to keep moving on. The original one is quite small make it end pretty soon (I got max tile 8192) but this one make the game go forever (tile 4m but still want to stick with it)
5,"January 25, 2015","Just One Problem My score is 10464724 at the moment, and the score bar is so long that the title which is beside it has been pushed down, making the 2048 grid go lower too. This has made the bottom squares covered by the ad. I was wondering if in the next update you could move.the game higher on the screen? Thanks!"
3,"October 4, 2015","Large games take forever If you can win the original 2048 consistently, then don't play this game on large.  I've been on the same game for months with no indication of being close to losing.  Also the undo is nice, but only being able to undo one move is annoying since most of my accidental swipes happen in two's."

4,"June 30, 2014",Great time waster! Great way to keep on playing the same game on. However there is a problem - control is so sensetive that having a finger too close to the screen when thinking causes a move. It's not fun when this happens and you have 32k blocks on there board.
2,"September 13, 2014",I like the game not the app I think the tiles are too small. I sipped the auto button on accident and it was like watching someone else play. This game is easier than the other 2048 game I played but it is also challenging to me. I won the first time and it was so easy and boring.

The ads on the bottom of the screen (which I don't mind) are now covering my bottom line of my field, which means I can't play anymore. Is there any way to fix this?"
5,"June 25, 2014",Better than original Ignore all the idiots saying that the board is too big. They just dont understand how settings work
3,"October 19, 2014",It will ruin your life. I'm playing this for like 2 hours a day and i just can't stop. It's ridiculous. Deleting it now because i want my life back. But it has been great.
4,"September 26, 2014",Good but too addictive Only played this game once. Played for an hour or two roughly a day for a couple of weeks. Highly addictive though...my boyfriend started to confiscate my phone so I wouldn't play. Deleting it now!
3,"August 8, 2014","Long, but not challenging I achieved the 2048 square on my first try, but it took a while. The large space takes the challenge away. Kinda boring, not my cup of tea."
3,"August 28, 2014",Decent game I downloaded and played this once and on my very first try it took me 15 maybe 20 minutes to get 2048. Little to easy for me. Could be because I played the game THREES.
5,"July 26, 2014","Best 2048 game out there!! I like the idea of auto move,also how hard i try to lose the game I can't so I should call this game as the ‚Äúnever ending 2048‚Äù."
5,"September 25, 2014",I love its awesome :-) Its awesome its like the best game I have played ever and/PS im 8 and have bin playing this game or installed it Sept 25 2014 And it keep it up its so awesome and ya sorry about the other people that aren't being nice about the comments so ya love it plz make more like it and ya bye :-)
5,"June 4, 2014","Previously stuck on 8 miljon piece! 33554432 in one piece now, thanks for fixing that bug!"
4,"June 12, 2014","Fun, but... I've found that the game can be jumpy and ""double move"" causing frustration. But for the most part, a fun game."
1,"June 6, 2014",Addictive I installed this after I got addicted to the first one. The problem is google has an ad directly at the bottom of my screen completely blocking my view of the last row. I've tried everything and it's still there! That means I CAN'T PLAY IT!  Either tell me what to do or I'm uninstalling
4,"July 8, 2014", Only one undo allowed? That's awfully unforgiving. Fun though.
3,"July 24, 2014","I Love the game, but.... I've been playing the same board for over a month. But as my score gets larger, my board gets smaller. I can only see 5 1/2 of the 8 lines. PLEASE FIX!!"
5,"October 3, 2014",Great But i have a problem on android 4.2.2 two days ago it stopped working i tried reinstalling it but it didn't help. What is the problem?
4,"September 16, 2014","Chemistry! :D Chemical elements? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY FREE TIME (since I don't have money)! Only problem is, the animation is too slow; I swipe faster than it can handle and it gets confused."
5,"August 29, 2014","Good Game Add an option to reset custom skin. Anyway the longer one plays, the more boring it gets"
5,"July 20, 2014", I play this game from last month and still going until now. I have found 2097152 tile. Addictive and I don't know how to stop.
4,"September 6, 2014", It'd be 5 stars if it didn't adjust after I hit 100 thousand points and cause the ads to block my view of the whole bottom row. It's nice to be able to see all of the numbers you have. Doesn't seem to matter which board either..
5,"June 4, 2014",Amazing This game has no faults and you can undo a move if it is accidently moved the wrong way.  I would definately reccommend it.
1,"July 12, 2014"," When I tried to download it, when it said 75% it stopped downloading. Is it my phone or the app?"
1,"July 9, 2014",Don't waste your time Downloaded app first move I went counter clockwise and no matter what the tiles looked like I continued going counter clockwise and after 20 minutes had a 4096 tile over 50 thousand points. .....could have gone on forever probably. ....waste of time........deleted
5,"September 1, 2014",Great app Awsome really addictive. I like the second chance and the new update. And there are different grid sizes which the original 2048 did.  I would recommend it to anyone:-)
2,"October 22, 2014",Too much of a knock-off Creator didn't work out the math quite right. The 8x8 board is WAY too easy once you figure out what the pattern should look like.
4,"September 5, 2014","Addicting To a developed brain could play this game could go forever, it has a satisfactory scoreboard method and a unique type of goal. You can continue to play the same game for days without having to deal with any obstacles commonly found in the original 2048 game."
5,"June 17, 2014","I just can't get enough! Wow, what a surprise this one was! I thought I'd get bored after an hr or so but after winning the game a couple of wks ago I am still playing every day! I have some insane amount of points, too.;)"
4,"October 4, 2014",Its good Its the only game that keeps my boredom away
1,"July 10, 2014","Crap with adware Sorry dude, don't besmirch my 2048 with crap advertisements."
1,"August 1, 2014",Hi I would have given it one more star but sometimes i keep playing it and get bored so you have to keep it more interesting so that the person can keep playing it and luv it:-! But good
5,"September 10, 2014","I actually lost. I did it. It took forever but I did it. When I look in the comment section, I see nothing but untapped potential. If I can do it so can you."
4,"October 5, 2014", Very addictive It  does stop I had to make myself find out if it ends n it does but it would b hours before or days before u get yo he over very very addictive
4,"June 18, 2014",Fun But way too easy. Still on first go after weeks....
2,"July 7, 2014",Good idea! I really like the idea but the gameplay doesn't feel as smooth as the original 2048. I will rate 5 stars if it get fix
5,"September 27, 2014","Awesome.. I reached a score of 9 million in 5x5 game.. In 2 weeks And game is still on, and would love to see if someone on earth has been doing such high scores .."
1,"July 12, 2014",So stupid Wanna win draw a square over and over the game will play itself for you and you will win.
2,"June 12, 2014",New update Just did the new update and now the adds cover my bottom line ... fix it and I will rate better
5,"September 11, 2014","Great game I have only played 1 game and I'm at 500,000+ and counting. Anyway love it, because it's like normal 2048, but with more stuff."
5,"August 19, 2014",My favorite First I hate this game after I loved it this is not at all boring
5,"August 26, 2014","Todos los 2048 en un solo lugar Puedes modificar  pr√°cticamente todo, jugar con n√∫meros con letras, elementos qu√≠micos, etc y en todos los tama√±os.  Es r√°pido tmb"
1,"June 4, 2014",New bug Crashes immediately. Won't open at all
5,"October 24, 2014",I did it! I finished the game! Very addictive. I love the new skin themes too.
2,"June 20, 2014", Cannot see the bottom 3 rows of the game.
5,"July 18, 2014",Awesome Highly addictive and doesnt pry into your phones system settings contacts ect how aps should be great stuff.
5,"October 15, 2014",Awesome This game is so addictive I cannot stop playing this game I love it keep up the great work
5,"October 2, 2014",i loved it awesome . is better than the original 4x4 . when i play the 8x8 i just swipe the screen all over then a get score 50000
1,"August 8, 2014","Cant be downloaded. -.-"" It doesnt install. I hate it."
4,"September 2, 2014","Good game Really like the fact that it's not just 2048, it has more different sizes of the board you play on"
5,"August 7, 2014",Helps This game helps me with my math skills. I have all ready told three of my friends about this game. I ask the same of you.

5,"August 14, 2014",Cool game 
5,"July 19, 2014",must try 
5,"May 7, 2014",My life is over. This is an excellent app but it's taken over my life. I have become so obsessed with beating my boyfriend I'm losing sleep over this.
4,"May 18, 2014","Amazing I love this app, but a leader board where everyone could see the best scores would be awesome. This is such a time killer! I'm obsessed"
1,"May 13, 2014","Crap. No landscape orientation support so you have to play sideways.  AI feature is neat, but the AI is so awful it can't even solve to 1024."
5,"May 10, 2014",Amazing Both in game and theory. This app teaches us how to think outside of the box in a fun and creative way. This is one addicting game I will not be giving up on or deleting anytime soon!
5,"May 31, 2014","Wow I've been trying to lose this game for a month but its impossible,  I applaud the game for that. Never in my have have I not been able to purposely lose a game before"
2,"May 26, 2014",Bug I have been playing this game for 2 days. I made a tile of 16384 and was working on making another 16384 to join them.  But out of no where 65536 pops up. Surely a bug somewhere.
5,"May 12, 2014","Very good app Once, while undoing, the game glitched and filled the grid, otherwise it is fantastic. Alternate skins and grid sizes are great"
5,"May 8, 2014",It's took over my life I've spent hours but my finger's still swapping. Please let the game over! Please....
3,"May 12, 2014","Good. However, it is missing some features. Please add unlimited undos and a dark theme! Also, could the auto move be a bit smarter? Will give five stars when these features are added."
5,"May 30, 2014",Love this game This is one of my fav versions of this game. I can play it for hours. Very very addictive.
4,"May 9, 2014","32768 with 500k points Current record, but I don't know if it's The best I can do, because the game isn't over yet."
4,"June 3, 2014",A not so good copy Which turns out to be a good spin off
5,"June 1, 2014",Best game ever It's addictive and fun
5,"May 17, 2014", This big grid makes it easy to solve finished 2048 at first attempt of this game wow gr8 game!!
5,"May 20, 2014", It's a fun game. I love all of the different settings. Changing the skins is my favorite :)
5,"May 14, 2014"," Game continues even after the goal, 2048, had been reached"
5,"May 9, 2014",Nope Record 65536 with 1 Million+ points

I just can't put it down. It took me all night to drink one beer because I couldn't stop playing long enough to take another swig. It's ruined my sex life because I'm more interested in playing this than shagging. Only 4 stars because the undo button only undoes one move! Otherwise it would be 5 stars.
5,"May 1, 2014",Flexible for long lifetime You can keep trying new things in this one so the game is a lot of fun and won't get boring Also I was wondering if someone could explain the differences between the auto move modes (swing etc) and the sliding modes (continuous etc)

3,"May 4, 2014",Why so easy Is this game supposed to be really easy? Am I missing a specific goal in what makes it challenging?

And I thought that that was the biggest grid, so I decided to stay committed to it. So a total of about 8-10 hours of game play later, such such tedious gameplay.... and finally the moment I had been waiting for for so long, matching the two 32.7k tiles to get the 65k tile.. and they just disappeared. I had messed up a few times so I ended up having 3 separate 32k tiles. I had a score of about 1.2 million and pretty much gave up."

1,"April 14, 2014",After update terrible The update doesn't let you use all the autorun features and it makes u chose a board size. I hate this
1,"April 15, 2014",Geeez Difference from original....this has bigger place to move and works slower than original and has annoying ad down at screen all the time.so...useless tbh.

2,"April 14, 2014",Some upgrades are not While I have lost several games in progress but with the save option I could save the partial game. Further this was the only version with the corner autoplay. Want it back
4,"April 16, 2014",Sensitive Good game but the swiping is very sensitive. If I barely touch the screen it will swipe when I don't want it to.
5,"April 16, 2014","Excellent, but... Great porting. I can only play the 6x6 version tho..."

1,"April 9, 2014", Dont work
4,"April 6, 2014","Nice but It's gonna be very difficult to beat the game, say if you swipe every one second, it'll will take you around 30 years non stop to get to that 2 billion tiles... Sure you can use the automatic (cheat) moves reducing the time by maybe 10... That upscale of the '2048 game' is unbeatable! Fun though"

stickers and frames. Endless tools. And if you don't know how to use 
something they take you to a tutorial."
5,"June 15, 2018"," I've tried em all.. seriously. The amount of ads in relationship to the 
functionality is astounding when discussing the free version. Pay the $2 
and get your mind blown. Takes a bit of commitment to become familiar with 
the tools but as with all things.. the payoff is equal to the investment."
5,"July 17, 2018"," Like the other reviews have, this is hands down #1 when it comes to photo 
editing. They have so many filters, stickers, effects, etc that other apps 
don't have. Wish I'd known about this sooner."
5,"June 15, 2018"," This app is loaded with options. It's not glitchy or slow, no hang ups. 
It's a little complicated at first but that's due to the amount of tools 
available. Great app!"

guys could add a ""personal signature"" feature to the ""text"" feature. Other 
than that, keep being awesome"

photos, the picture loses immensive quality. That is where VSCO is better 
when it comes to overall picture quality."
5,"June 15, 2018"," It's the best app to do any kind of editing you want or need. Plus they are 
always adding newer and cooler editing every week"
3,"June 17, 2018", Ads covering tools makes app less useful than earlier version.
5,"June 12, 2018"," It's a good app but having to pay for premium each time I install it is

it and find out why it's not doing it. The gallery they have is awesome

all of my other editing apps. My only suggestions are there should be a 
removal selection, where you can just select the area you want gone and 
presto. Also when it comes to slimming the body, there should be a way to 
manually do it, so you can selwct where and how much you want done because 
the way it is now doesn't work very well, just kinda makes the whole 
picture look thinner, there isnt one which to me is very important. I would 
also love to be able to do a manual when is comes to red eye removal, don't 
really understand how this one works? When I try it leaves a black spot. I 
think there should be more options on lens flare and light leak or at least 
an option to upload more. But all in all it's an amazing app that I will 
always use and I've been telling everyone I know to download it!!"

There are lot features that can be use but still can't satisfy me and I need to use other apps for editing. Here are my suggestions: *Patch and healing - why not doing it multiple times with the same adjustments? I hate it adjusting again and again. *Face tune - use only demabrasion or whitening in manual, I hate erasing all the background. Face detection of skin may help. *Makeup - I need to use makeup app in order to beautify your face. Having different hair, eyebrows, eye lens, lips, countour and etc.. *Blending and Layer - must have perspective positioning the image for example I want to replace the image in the billboard. *Different brushes - use to paint and add effects just like in photoshop. Another thing, some tools doesn't have a tutorial. A lot of improvement and additional tools will be nice and hoping this will the best app to all that I dont need to use other. :)"

that sit around on the screen while your using other apps... The only way 
to stop this is to force close the app or ununstall.. I still plan to try 
it for it's photo features, but will be force closing Everytime I'm done I

1,"June 10, 2018"," My entore phone is one big ad since I installed this app..just to open the 
screen I have n ad. Can't click off the ad. Have to wait for web site to 
open and close it...ice blocked over 25 ads permanently. Never use this app"
3,"June 9, 2018"," I loved the tools, how easy it was to use, and the cool sticker feature 
that let's you erase! But the ads are horrible. They pop up when I'm not 
even using the app, and it's very frustrating. I really liked this app, but 
going to have to uninstall."
1,"June 12, 2018"," I get having ads in an app, but I seriously thought something was wrong 
with my phone when I started getting these pop up ads even when I wasn't 
using this app. Otherwise, it's a decent photo edit app. Uninstalling now."

I get an add (even after making sure all my apps have been force closed). 
And all the adds are for sleazy singles apps. Unistall Immediately!!!!!!"

anyway. üòí"
2,"June 13, 2018"," i loved the app itself. had a great selection of filters, lots of great 
editing stuff, but way too many ads. i had to uninstall because even when i 
wasn't using the app, it spammed my phone with pop up ads and made my phone 
lag."
1,"June 10, 2018"," Ads on my homepage and lock screen. Over laying other apps. I understand 
ads while using a free product but I haven't opened the app for 2 days and 
got flooded with ads."
5,"June 11, 2018"," In my opinion,This should be highly recommend for many reasons. Not only 
can you edit photos, you can also do collages with multiple videos or 
photos. This was great for me and my sister who like doing this kind of 
stuff. Thank you for making such a useful app."
5,"June 13, 2018"," I think its great, i use it often becuaee i make edits and its easy to use. 
But the ads are a little annoying :/"
5,"June 13, 2018"," Seems like a great app. As long as it doesn't download it's own version of 
screensavers, I may keep it!"
5,"June 3, 2018"," I love this app. Not only can I make beautiful collages of my family, but 
also helps me make designs and adds for my small business."

and it took me 2 min"
3,"June 19, 2018"," This app is great for editing but after you have it for about a week or two 
ads will pop up on your phone even when you don't have the app open. It's 
like every time I open my phone there is an ad"
2,"June 15, 2018"," Doesn't work for what it showed it would do when I saw it advertised on my 
Facebook. Thought it would change hair color, put makeup on me, ect. but 
all it did was smear makeup on face. Hair colors don't look right either"

3,"May 25, 2018"," Was a great app but I had to uninstall it because the ads were completely 
out of control. I get businesses needed money but unavoidable bubble pop up 
ads on the home screen is unacceptable"
3,"May 21, 2018"," I'd give it 5 stars if these unwanted ads didn't pop up all over my phone. 
The actual app works amazingly. But these ads tempt me to just delete it. 
Which I'll probably end up doing if this doesn't change."
5,"May 15, 2018"," So far so good. Just started using it and getting to know what's what. A 
beginners tutorial should be created to show first time users how to do the 
basic stuff lice cropping, cutting and pasting, etc."

fake because it literally behaves like Malware. Look elsewhere."

come up with more backgrounds and frames though it would be amazing"

picture in it."

A new paint effect option with bokeh, glitter, hearts,  stars , etc. .   If you're a photo--artist, Photo Studio pro is THE AP for you.  Worth EVERY SINGLE penny! Dude, go for it !"

this. Please don't add a user community, or if you must, make a separate

5,"December 24, 2017"," Awesome editing tool. The only thing I wish they improved was how to access your photos better, especially if you have a lot of pictures in your library. My go-to app for photo editing."

Amazing high standard and user friendly app. Few glitches and the stickers now show up in my phone gallery. Also crashes a lot when using frames and when you use the auto fix with multiple frames and filters. The text shadows move even after you set it. But still my favourite app!! I spent hours and hours editing pics and have paid 4 times as my google accounts were hacked so I say this so that you developers know how much o love this app. Also good work on the user friendly GUI just one request change the pro app to not have to download everything make it immediately available. the other great thing the free version doesn't add a logo on images though the ads are annoying but it doesnt bother much just remove the pro choices from the freeware and add an ad at the beginning or on save at the end. As for the pro version splash screen ads after i paid for the app and it is annoying when an ad pops up while editing. Please no. Just no. I've paid for this app 4 times i hate ads pleaseeee thanks still 5 stars!!
5,"December 23, 2017"," Absolutely the best!! And when there's something new, you don't get charged for it. Pay once for the Pro version and you'll never have to take out your wallet again."
5,"January 9, 2018", Have had for long time. Just started using it again.
5,"January 14, 2018", I had an older version & it's been a while. Need a refresher! But I like the new stuff you can do with photos.
4,"December 26, 2017", Love the filters but not the fact I have to keep adding to this when I want a special background or filter. Uses too much space.

4,"October 12, 2017"," They moved the AutoCorrect feature in the latest version, which threw me because I couldn't locate it. Ugh. Devs love to do this sort of thing which is frustrating. At least it's still a feature, which makes me happy."
5,"October 8, 2017", This program ranks up there with the best. The big thing for me besides all the customizability is that there is a version for my laptop too so i can work with it either way.
5,"October 7, 2017"," This is the best photograph app I have used TO DATE. It was hard for me to find one that I could use because I don't know much about the terms or photography. Needless to say, I can use this one, and use it well. üòâ"
1,"October 6, 2017", App is trash.  It's so buggy.  Anytime you make an edit on a photo...it will flip it 90 degrees...but when you edit the photo...it is normal.  so dont over write any pictures because they will be worthless...it completely changes the file and makes it trash
5,"October 5, 2017", Everything were fine but i really hate your f*****g ads... White the pro version you have to remover those things.
2,"October 6, 2017", I'd give it 4 stars if not for ads that interfere in usability. I use it to create cognitive & sensory photos for my health. Your additions are now accessibility challenges!
5,"October 28, 2017", Best app out there!!!!! No issues or freeze up. Gives you editing freedom like you can only imagine the possibilities!
4,"October 6, 2017", It's pissing me off. Won't show the colors I've chosen for the ink until I've complete the pic and there's no going back. Either I have to start from scratch or just hope the colors work in the end.
5,"October 26, 2017"," Best app I've used for editing next to photo shop.  So much easier and cheaper to use than photo shop.  And the free version is awesome too! Don't find that to often,  been using it almost 2years.  I'm pretty fkn happy with this app."
5,"November 1, 2017"," Awesome picture app! I will definitely recommend this to family and friends! The frames are sweet and the effects are amazing, anyone looking for an app for pictures stop here and download! You will love it!"
4,"October 21, 2017"," i'm like, but don't exist + the auto fix photo options, is good funtion"
4,"October 24, 2017", I've given 4 Stars because I tried using the clone tool and no matter what I do it isn't applying over the area I move the cloned area to. Apart from that everything else works brilliantly.
5,"October 10, 2017", Completely worth the purchase! Love it!!  10/10/17 : Minor glitches after last update were completely fixed! The app is perfect again!! üòÑ

5,"October 2, 2017"," It's quite good. It allows me to resize photos, unlike the current Android Gallery Photo Editor Pro - which no longer does."
3,"September 28, 2017", When in design mode using PIPS everything looks great but when I save the pics move around... And I cannot edit
5,"September 17, 2017", I'm loving this application to till then my death End

5,"September 1, 2017"," This is the best app that so far I have ever used. I've tried 5 or 6 other similar apps, no other app even comes close to this one. They kept adding new and even cooler add on's.....keep it up!!!!"
3,"June 20, 2017", It won't let me download any of the new add-ons. I've even reset my Wi-Fi on my phone and my router with no success.
1,"July 20, 2017", Google said to reinstall and then it made me pay 4.99 again. Scam
4,"July 7, 2017", Still need more stickers and frames also glass effect should have a option glass should drag where we want to
2,"October 17, 2017", The worst paid photo editing app. The app isn't optimised and the effects are tacky.
4,"July 26, 2017", I want to highlight some texts on my screen capture (e.g.from a sports article) by drawing a red line box around these block of texts. Can I do this with this app?
5,"December 9, 2017", Love this app! Purchased the Pro version years ago and its been my go to photo editing app ever since. I will always have this app on my device
5,"August 23, 2017"," This is an Awesome app, you can make changes to any photo and still keep the original photo intact. I would give it 10 stars."
4,"July 4, 2017"," After re-installing a year later, I'm very happy with all the fixes. Great effects, frames, decor & stickers!"
4,"July 4, 2017", Photo Editor is great. Easy to use. Good variety. Wish it had object removal. But why ruin a good thing.
5,"September 13, 2017", Add some more like bokeh effect or portrait mode
3,"August 12, 2017", In pic frame function Zoom in and Zoom out feature is required as seen in  Sony album in Xperia mobile
5,"August 21, 2017"," Its just THE BEST Just need to know where all the files for the effects, filters etc packages are saved."
5,"August 31, 2017", I really must say....it is really nice and easy to use. I  just a country bumpkin and it gives me thrills for just pittance. Keep it up.
5,"August 10, 2017", Amazing results! Fun to use! Love all the tools available. Among my favorite apps.

I didn't really know how great and powerful this is until I couldn't use it anymore, and tried others not finding what I needed.  See I started using this app because it was embedded in Verizon's message+ stock messaging. Photo studio was the only reason I was using vz message plus, it allowed seemles editing and it only took a few clicks to get from inside the messaging app to the photo studio editor and back to the messaging app. One day photo studio was no longer part of Verizon's message+. So I started my quest. I ended up dumping vzmessage+. Back to this app... One great feature in this app is the grid while editing as well as the ability to zoom while adding marks on the picture, or being able to scroll using 2 finger swipe. These seem so basic but I found no other app that did it like photo studio. Other apps do it but it takes more clicks to get around.  The biggest plus is that I now go from my preferred messaging app to photo studio and back to attaching the picture in almost the same amount of clicks as when it was embedded in vz message+. Actually a few more, but this is ok. If you used message plus and you miss photo studio like I did until now. Get photo studio pro well worth the 5 bucks , then  pair it up with Android messages and you will be very happy!!!.  To flow from on to the other include the messaging app album from within photo studio, then you will have direct access to pictures saved to this folder, u will be able to edit and share with a few clicks. !!!  Hope this was helpful;-)!"

I tested each one of them according to my requirements but all apps failed except this calculator app N-CALC. Highly recommended.   These are the reasons among all the other reasons why i like this app:  1. It gives u maximum number of digits in the answer no matter how long your calculation is.  2. Maximum number of digits after decimal.  3. No lag or hang.  4. Very smooth and responsive
