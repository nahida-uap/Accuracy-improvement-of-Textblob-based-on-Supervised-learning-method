The only things I wish you would add is the ability to upload more than one photo FROM my phone's gallery to Facebook, and to upload them directly to FB albums. This app only gives the option of uploading one photo to my wall or in a message.  Because of this flaw I must keep another app just for that purpose. Also, can't save/download photos. Update -12/10/17- I am still using the Metal app to upload multiple photos to my wall and directly to FB albums. It also uses less space than this ""lite"" app. You said I can upload more than one photo to Facebook FROM my phone's gallery, but this app does not show that option. When trying,  the only options are ""Wall"" or ""Message."" How do I do it? I now see I can save/download photos from FB, but it requires opening the photo in another window. That's 3 steps to save.

I think you should add an interface/mode wherein users can actually create

collect and to save stickers that I want to use always or the stickers that 
have the same color. I could create a folder and name it as ""pink stickers"" 
and insider that folder are SPECIFIC stickers that I normally use on a 
daily basis. I hope you could give this a try. I would be glad if this will 
come true. Goodluck! And also fix some common errors hehe."

I downloaded this to try out texting (or typing, rather) from the desktop, but aside from just sending out a message to someone, this is completely useless. It takes a full 5 minutes to send or recieve a text, effectively ruining the ability to have a conversation in a reasonable amount of time. Will probably uninstall and try again at another time to see if this works better, this is what i get for getting my hopes up."

There are lot features that can be use but still can't satisfy me and I need to use other apps for editing. Here are my suggestions: *Patch and healing - why not doing it multiple times with the same adjustments? I hate it adjusting again and again. *Face tune - use only demabrasion or whitening in manual, I hate erasing all the background. Face detection of skin may help. *Makeup - I need to use makeup app in order to beautify your face. Having different hair, eyebrows, eye lens, lips, countour and etc.. *Blending and Layer - must have perspective positioning the image for example I want to replace the image in the billboard. *Different brushes - use to paint and add effects just like in photoshop. Another thing, some tools doesn't have a tutorial. A lot of improvement and additional tools will be nice and hoping this will the best app to all that I dont need to use other. :)"

It kinda seems like both are having issues. Sometimes messages are stuck in ""sending..."" other times pictures aren't transmitted properly. Then a lot of times it'll just fall back to sending ""SMS""/""MMS"" because the service seems down/disconnected?! Also Messages for web often doesn't show the ""SMS""/""MMS"" label but still sends it as one. That could become quite pricey for people without a flat rate. My provider is Vodafone in Germany. You really need to do something about this.    Original review: With RCS support Android Message is fit for the future. And the new web client makes it easy to read & respond to messages (either SMS, MMS or RCS) on other devices like a laptop or desktop PC."
1,"July 24, 2018"," Calling in messenger not working on data. As soon as I call someone or they 
call me the 4G LTE turns off. It only works on WiFi. Note 8 running Oreo"
1,"June 29, 2018"," Although airtel has consented for the RCS support in india but still when i send message through wi-fi or data, i get deduction from my balance. it simply falls back to other messaging apps in a country like India where the data cost is Rs2.5/1Gb of data."

5,"July 8, 2017"," This app is great! Just downloaded it today and I have already earned 68 minutes just doing these easy surveys. The question I do have though that seems to be unanswered, is: Do your minutes ever expire? Or do they stay until you use them?"

Have tried clearing cache, data, uninstalling, re-installing, restarting the phone and such, but no, it just hangs. No intermediate app-update, just stopped working. Am I the only one? All I get is a white screen and then nothing. Thought at first that it's an internet connectivity issue, found out when out and about, but same on mobile network, as well as on stable and rock solid WiFi at home.  Answer: Everything else works, web browsers, and official FB messenger app works, on my phone, can't say more than that. Everything else works on the app as well, just the loading of messages that don't. Currently using an old Samsung phone.  EDIT: If I go to ""Online Friends"", I can click on any of them, and from there I can access and use messages, specifically for that user, still not when clicking the general ""Messages"" however, that hangs as before."

it would be perfect. There is no option to create a custom vibration for 
notification which is huge. Also no option for custom emoji or themes. As 
well as no do not disturb option for individual conversations. I hate to 
say it, but iMessage still has you guys beat here with features. If there 
was a way to implement all these similar features, the major app holding 
people back from switching wouldn't be such a powerful force. This messages 
app should be able to do everything iMessage can do and more. I know it's 
in the developers to do this, especially with RCS technology getting into 
the hands of the carriers, it should be no time that we can have an Android 
iMessage that likely will work better. While right now this app only gets 
one star from me, i know it will be better in the future."

If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer. But you don't have that choice once they delete app. Its strange you want to make your money from add customers and not cuz of a quality product when you indeed have such. That's called greedy and not proud of your product. Don't be greedy and in time Your product will stand on its own with lots of customers and less adds. Number two issue is I have to stop to let the texting catch up. And I'm not even the fastest typer. Its very frustrating. If I'm excited or even angry and therefore passionate about what I'm texting to someone, I don't want to have to stop...wait...for...the...words...I...text...to...catch...up...get it? Number three, when I choose a theme, should it not over ride any background pic I formerly decided to choose? The theme pops up on the keyboard and the boarder of background wallpaper behind the messages but the pic I had chosen as my wallpaper prior to the theme remains. It looks choppy as they are nowhere close to being anything of the same topic. If I can't get this resolved I will not keep app as I'm all about the visuals. Last but not least, when I'm composing a msg, the keyboard stays on top of the msg. I cannot see what I'm typing. Why? I'm a terrible typed and must review what I'm composing.

It even has the best and loudest in-app video player I've seen in these kinds of app. That said, notifications are a bit delayed, which is why I always miss calls. I also still can't share links, photos, or videos from my newsfeed to labeled group chats. I'd have to tag each member one by one and even then, my post would still show up on a duplicate thread with our names as the default label instead of appearing on the already existing thread with the customized group name. Also, I wanna use night mode but it doesn't look too good in my opinion because of the design and colors used. Some stuff aren't even clearly visible. The notification light blinks too fast and too long in its current configuration as well. Lastly, I hope you make it faster and easier to switch accounts from the left side drawer, make it possible to more conveniently download photos in chat just by long-pressing the thumbnails instead of opening them one by one, and make a way for us to be able to download videos, especially from chat threads, not just the newsfeed. UPDATE: Working links/attachments posted by other people on chat threads don't appear anymore. I'm sure it's not because the links are dead or the attachments are unavailable/taken down already as I can see and open them just fine on Messenger Lite. That said, I checked the Facebook desktop site/view on my mobile browser (Chrome app) and I don't see the links/attachments either, while Facebook's mobile view on said browser doesn't let us view messages at all, as usual and forces us to install the app or switch to the desktop site. By the way, sometimes the bottom advertisements block the option/button to see all notifications. Closing them doesn't even work because that just replaces them with other targeted advertising."
